# RestaurantApp
Project Title: Full-Stack Restaurant App

Description: Full-Stack Restaurant App that was built with Front-End architecture developed with Next.js using React, a Strapi/MongoDB database, that allows the user to log in, become authenticated, order from restuarants and submit a payment using Stripe.  

How to Run: To Run on your machine, pull the files into a local folder, install Docker, docker compose up to start the backend files, and build and run the image from the Dockerfile to get the front end running.  

Roadmap of Future Improvements:   Add the second authentication type using Oauth2 eventually.  I also would like to see this app be able to add restaurants and dishes using information from a service like Yelp, DoorDash, etc.
